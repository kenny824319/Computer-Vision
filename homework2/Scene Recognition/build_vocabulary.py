    # Load images from the training set. To save computation time, you don't         #
    # necessarily need to sample from all images, although it would be better        #
    # to do so. You can randomly sample the descriptors from each image to save      #
    # memory and speed up the clustering. Or you can simply call vl_dsift with       #
    # a large step size here.                                                        #

    # For each loaded image, get some SIFT features. You don't have to get as        #
    # many SIFT features as you will in get_bags_of_sift.py, because you're only     #
    # trying to get a representative sample here.                                    #

    # Once you have tens of thousands of SIFT features from many training            #
    # images, cluster them with kmeans. The resulting centroids are now your         #
    # visual word vocabulary.                                                        #

    # SIFT_features is a N x 128 matrix of SIFT features                             #
    # There are step, bin size, and smoothing parameters you can                     #
    # manipulate for dsift(). We recommend debugging with the 'fast'                 #
    # parameter. This approximate version of SIFT is about 20 times faster to        #
    # compute. Also, be sure not to use the default value of step size. It will      #
    # be very slow and you'll see relatively little performance gain from            #
    # extremely dense sampling. You are welcome to use your own SIFT feature.        #
